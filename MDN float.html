			<p>By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding + border width/height.</p>

			<p>inline elements<span> like this one</span> and<span> this one</span> sit on the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements will<span> wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do: <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13360/long.jpg" /></p>
